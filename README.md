## What is the essence of Tetris? :sparkles:
### Tetris is a popular game in which the player controls falling geometric shapes (called tetrominoes) and arranges them to create horizontal lines with no gaps. When a horizontal line is filled, it disappears, making room for the next shapes.
### The commercial version of the game :clap:, the first of many to follow, was released by the American company Spectrum HoloByte in 1987. In the following years, Tetris was ported in many different versions to a great variety of devices, including all sorts of computers and game consoles, as well as devices such as graphic calculators, mobile phones, media players, pocket personal computers
